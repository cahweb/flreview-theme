<p>calable Navigation
Navigation is one of the most challenging aspects of a responsive website to design effectively, especially when you are dealing with very large, deep menus.

What works perfectly well for larger screens will break down completely on other devices. This is why, when designing a site’s nav, you are not looking for a consistent navigation experience across every different screen site or major layout versions of your responsive site. Instead, you are focusing on creating clear, user friendly navigation every step of the way – even if the exact way that navigation is accessed differs from one screen to another.

Now, saying that you do not need to be consistent in your navigation’s design across different devices may sound like a major UX faux pas, so allow me to clarify this comment:  

You should be as consistent as possible in your navigation, including the labels used on buttons and links and the visual characteristics of those buttons (font choice, color, etc.).
Where you should break away from an insistence on consistency is in how the navigation works or lays out. A fly-out menu that is accessed via hover with a mouse may work perfectly fine for desktop visitors, but it will fall apart on touch screens and at small sizes. For those instances, the navigation you design should have a similar feel, but a different functionality appropriate to where it will be used (e.g. a navigation drawer).</p>
